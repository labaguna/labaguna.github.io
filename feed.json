Although it is fun to flip through glossy photos online, actual trip to site often disappoint. Not to mention the feeling of having wasted a good part of the day on the road. Of course, the first few trips are exciting. But after the fifth or so, you start to get tired. For every disappointing site inspection, doubt about having a country property increases. You start to wonder, does God actually want you to make this move to the country?</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>We have gone through this process ourselves twice. The first one was in 2009. It took us six months before we find the right land. With every inspection, we grew smarter. We not only read the ad carefully, but we rely heavily on the property reports available for free from Land Victoria.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Getting property reports is easy. You just need to follow a few simple steps. The two most useful reports are the basic property report and the planning property report. The basic report has information about the shire it is in, basic zoning etc. The planning property report has the detailed zoning and overlay information which is absolutely critical to understand. It dictates what can be done on the land and the challenges. If you are like most people, you will want to build a dwelling. Having the right zoning will save you lots of headache and heartache down the track.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>If you don't know how to get property reports in Victoria, please download this free PDF containing a step-by-step instruction.

Even worse, we feel exhausted after the long journey and late nights during the break. Yet we still go through the motion nonetheless.  </p>\n<p>It appears that the system of work nowadays makes us crave for a break. We just want to run away even for a little while from the daily routine. It doesn't matter where, as long as we can get our mind off work.</p>\n<p>Jesus said, \"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\" - Matthew 11:28. We have to understand that Jesus knows what he is talking about. He walked on earth among the sick and the hungry. He suffered much leading to his agonizing death on the cross. If you think Buddha is great, having left his palace and joined the common multitude, Jesus is at least ten times greater, as he left his heavenly abode. He came from the highest place, down to the lowliest.  </p>\n<p>When Jesus says \"I will give you rest\", that's what he will really give us, and it will be a true lasting rest. Not just a little break that at the end makes us even more exhausted. </p>\n<p>So for this long weekend, I'd encourage you instead of having a holiday, have a Holy Day. Join your local church for the Good Friday service and Easter Sunday service. If you are in Melbourne and don't have a church, come join us at <a href=\"http://griimelbourne.org/event.aspx?id=15979&amp;name=Kebaktian-Paskah-Minggu-sore\">GRII Melbourne</a>.</p>\n\n",

So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 12 Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.\"</p>\n<p>So to understand where we are going, we need two things:</p>\n<p>1.

It is not just my work. But it is my entire life. It's my life's mission. And yes, a significant part would be my work, but it is also my family, my leisure, and my legacy. In a way, yes, a calling is just one thing, but one wholistic thing encompassing your entire life.</p>\n<p>So if you are feeling stuck at work, don't despair. It is only a part of your calling. Don't forget that your family is your calling too. Your ministry is your calling. Your leisure time is your calling. And what you impart to other people along the way is also your calling.</p>\n<p>In the coming weeks, I will be exploring more about one's calling and what to do when you feel stuck at where you are now.
