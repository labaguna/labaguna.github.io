I think he has found the key to being <a title="Matthew 5:3" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A3&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poor in spirit</a>. There is a difference between having something and possessing it. To have, is neutral. Whereas to possess, has a strong and often negative connotation.</p><p>Abraham demonstrated his willingness to give up his son to God. If he would give up the thing he most valued, he would gladly give up everything else he owned. Abraham really possessed nothing. Yet God lets him keep everything, including his son. And so here was the man, who had all the wealth the nations seek, yet truly poor in spirit. He enjoyed loving family and worldly riches, yet fully aware that they were not really his. That all things belong to God, and he was granted the privilege for temporary use only.</p><p>The Buddhists advocate non attachment, and so they prefer to live in isolated monasteries. And of course it is easier to be detached from material possession,  if you really have nothing. But Christians are the <a title="Light of the world" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:14-16&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light of the world</a>. So we face a greater challenge, because we can and do have things yet we ought not possess them.</p><blockquote><a title="Job 1:21" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1%3A21&amp;version=NKJV"><span id="en-NKJV-12891" class="text Job-1-21">Job 1:21</span></a><p></p><p><span id="en-NKJV-12891" class="text Job-1-21">And he said:</span></p><div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Job-1-21">“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,</span> <span class="text Job-1-21">And naked shall I return there.</span> <span class="text Job-1-21">The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> has taken away;</span> <span class="text Job-1-21">Blessed be the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</span></p></div></blockquote></div><footer><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://labaguna.com/authors/johan/" class="invert" title="Johan">Johan</a></h3></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://labaguna.com/to-do-good-and-enjoy-the-work.html" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">To do good and enjoy the work</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://labaguna.com/when-good-things-become-the-norm.html" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">When good things become the norm</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
