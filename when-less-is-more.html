In an old diary of her mother's she discovered Ella's prescription for contentment:<ul><li>Never allow yourself to complain about anything not even the weather</li><li>Never picture yourself in any other circumstances or someplace else</li><li>Never compare your lot with another's</li><li>Never allow yourself to wish this or that had been otherwise</li><li>Never dwell on tomorrow- remember that tomorrow is God's, not yours.</li></ul><p>Ella's eyes were fixed on eternity. Her tomorrows belonged to God. She had given them to Him. And because all her tomorrows belonged to God. She had given them to Him. And because all her tomorrows were nestled in God's strong arms, she was free to live today.</p><p> </p><hr><p> </p></blockquote><p> </p></div><footer><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://labaguna.com/authors/natalie/" class="invert" title="Natalie">Natalie</a></h3></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://labaguna.com/seeds-of-peace.html" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">Seeds of Peace</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://labaguna.com/to-do-good-and-enjoy-the-work.html" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">To do good and enjoy the work</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div><div class="post__related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5">Related posts</h2><div class="l-grid l-grid--4"><article class="c-card"><a href="https://labaguna.com/covid-19-lesson-1.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://labaguna.com/media/posts/68/137ff-w9keokhajkw.jpg" srcset="https://labaguna.com/media/posts/68/responsive/137ff-w9keokhajkw-xs.jpg 300w, https://labaguna.com/media/posts/68/responsive/137ff-w9keokhajkw-sm.jpg 480w, https://labaguna.com/media/posts/68/responsive/137ff-w9keokhajkw-md.jpg 768w, https://labaguna.com/media/posts/68/responsive/137ff-w9keokhajkw-lg.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 56.25em) 100vw, (min-width: 37.5em) 50vw, 100vw" loading="lazy" height="900" width="1600" alt=""></a><div class="c-card__wrapper"><header class="c-card__header"><h3 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://labaguna.com/covid-19-lesson-1.html" class="invert">COVID-19 Lesson 1</a></h3></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><time datetime="2020-03-23T08:58">March 23, 2020</time></footer></div></article><article class="c-card"><a href="https://labaguna.com/when-good-things-become-the-norm.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://labaguna.com/media/posts/59/bd338-2tlrezi7bug.jpg" srcset="https://labaguna.com/media/posts/59/responsive/bd338-2tlrezi7bug-xs.jpg 300w, https://labaguna.com/media/posts/59/responsive/bd338-2tlrezi7bug-sm.jpg 480w, https://labaguna.com/media/posts/59/responsive/bd338-2tlrezi7bug-md.jpg 768w, https://labaguna.com/media/posts/59/responsive/bd338-2tlrezi7bug-lg.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 56.25em) 100vw, (min-width: 37.5em) 50vw, 100vw" loading="lazy" height="1038" width="1600" alt=""></a><div class="c-card__wrapper"><header class="c-card__header"><h3 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://labaguna.com/when-good-things-become-the-norm.html" class="invert">When good things become the norm</a></h3></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><time datetime="2015-06-25T23:40">June 25, 2015</time></footer></div></article><article class="c-card"><a href="https://labaguna.com/when-theres-too-many-things-to-do-in-a-day.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://labaguna.com/media/posts/36/img_0783_qumul7.jpg" srcset="https://labaguna.com/media/posts/36/responsive/img_0783_qumul7-xs.jpg 300w, https://labaguna.com/media/posts/36/responsive/img_0783_qumul7-sm.jpg 480w, https://labaguna.com/media/posts/36/responsive/img_0783_qumul7-md.jpg 768w, https://labaguna.com/media/posts/36/responsive/img_0783_qumul7-lg.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 56.25em) 100vw, (min-width: 37.5em) 50vw, 100vw" loading="lazy" height="896" width="1200" alt=""></a><div class="c-card__wrapper"><header class="c-card__header"><h3 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://labaguna.com/when-theres-too-many-things-to-do-in-a-day.html" class="invert">When there&#x27;s too many things to do in a day</a></h3></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><time datetime="2014-08-25T13:53">August 25, 2014</time></footer></div></article></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
